<p>In 1998, I was a programming geek who loved weight lifting, anime, and video games.</p>
<p>In 2008, I became a mom &ndash; that was really hard!</p>
<p>In 2009, I was diagnosed with a rare cancer &ndash; that was much worse!</p>
<p>After a year of experimental treatment, I was physically, emotionally, and mentally broken.</p>
<p>Determined to see my baby grow, I went on a quest to find health.</p>
<p>This quickly spiraled out into a spiritual voyage.</p>
<p>I questioned everything I thought was true.</p>
<p>The answers set me free.</p>
