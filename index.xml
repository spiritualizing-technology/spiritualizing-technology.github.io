About the Author My name is Wendy Closson.
In 1998, I was a programming geek who loved weight lifting, anime, and video games.
In 2008, I became a mom &amp;ndash; that was really hard!
In 2009, I was diagnosed with a rare cancer &amp;ndash; that was much worse!
After a year of experimental treatment, I was physically, emotionally, and mentally broken.</description>
