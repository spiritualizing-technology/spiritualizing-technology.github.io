      <description>In the physical world, playing background music is easy. You just play it.
Not so much in the virtual world.
Fear not! I enlisted my eleven year old to help make a tutorial to demonstrate how to add music to a Zoom meeting.
Step by step instructions:
  Start or Join the Zoom Meeting
  Click the &amp;ldquo;Share Screen&amp;rdquo; button on the menu   A new window will open &amp;ndash; Click the &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo; option   Select &amp;ldquo;Music or Computer Sound Only&amp;rdquo;   Hit &amp;ldquo;Share&amp;rdquo;   Some Tech Details Applications like Zoom want to make sure the person speaking is heard.</description>
